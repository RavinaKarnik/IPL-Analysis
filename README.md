🏏 Just wrapped up the 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝟏𝟎 with Codebasics, and it's been an exhilarating journey! 🚀


In this challenge, I delved deep into 𝐈𝐏𝐋 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, unraveling intriguing insights and making predictions for IPL 2024. 📊 These insights were shared with "𝐒𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬".

📈 From this analysis, I curated a stellar team of 11 players who demonstrated remarkable teamwork and prowess.

🌟 Additionally, I identified 𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐩 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐩 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫𝐬 for each season, adding depth to the analysis. 🧢
